## Version old-2
Ptakopět (Překlad tam a kontrolně zpět) is a system for agile forward and backward translation together with quality estimation. This project was created as a semestral assignment for _Semestral project_, a class at Charles University Faculty of Mathematics and Physics in summer semester (version old-2) with help of Ondřej Bojar.

### Usage
The frontend contains three windows (input, translation, backward translation). On user input rudimentary form of translation quality estimation is shown.

### Class requirements
Full deployment of both server and frontend parts with robust translation interface.

## Version old-1

Version old-1 was developed as a browser addon. It is no longer maintained. Ptakopět (Překlad tam a kontrolně zpět) is a browser agnostic (mostly) plugin/page script for agile forward and backward translation. This project was created as a semestral assignment for _Competing in Machine Translation_, a class at Charles University Faculty of Mathematics and Physics in winter semester 2018 (version old-1).

It was available in Chrome, Firefox and Opera. Include this snippet to use Ptakopět explicitly on your page:

```<script id='ptakopet_init' src='dev/ptakopet/js/ptakopet_init.js'></script>```


### Usage
This project can be used as a browser extension, or as a script that webmasters can add to their pages.

### Class requirements
Full implementation of Ptakoět frontend together with distribution (Chrome Web Store, Add-ons for Firefox and Opera addons) and user documentation.
