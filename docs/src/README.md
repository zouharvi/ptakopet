Ptakopět is a system for user friendly quality estimation [ptakopet.vilda.net](https://ptakopet.vilda.net). It can be used for translating texts to a language you are not really familiar with (outbound translation) or estimation the quality of your own translation (simple quality estimation).
It was created first as a semestral project and then as part of Bergamot.
