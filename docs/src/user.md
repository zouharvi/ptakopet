PtakopÄ›t is a system for user friendly quality estimation ptakopet.vilda.net. It can be used for translating texts to a language you are not really familiar with (outbound translation) or estimation the quality of your own translation (simple quality estimation). The user is expected to use the web frontend provided at [ptakopet.vilda.net](https://ptakopet.vilda.net/). The webpage contains three text areas (see Figure 1).

Intuitively the langauge selection boxes specify source and target languages. Available language pairs may vary according to the selected translation backend (bottom right corner). Except for the default settings, translation backend, quality estimation backend and alignment backend can be further specified. Despite that it is not required of the user to change the default backend settings.

After typing some text into the input textarea element, indicators on the bottom right side will be animated to indicate pending requests. After these requests are finished, an output appears (translation and quality estimation). Generally the more red the color highlighting is, the worse the quality of the word is (see Figure 2).

The input text can be reedited, just as the translated text. The later would provide a quality estimation of user's own translation.
