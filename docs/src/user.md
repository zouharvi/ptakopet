PtakopÄ›t is a system for user friendly quality estimation ptakopet.vilda.net. It can be used for translating texts to a language you are not really familiar with (outbound translation) or estimation the quality of your own translation (simple quality estimation). The user is expected to use the web frontend provided at [ptakopet.vilda.net](https://ptakopet.vilda.net/). The webpage contains four boxes:

After typing some text into the top left input box, indicators above the boxes will be animated to indicate pending requests. After these requests are finished, an output appears (translation and quality estimation) in the top right box. Afterwards a backward translation will appear in the source language in the bottom left box. Paraphrases are available in the bottom right box.

The input text can be reedited, just as the translated text. The later would provide a quality estimation of user's own translation. 

Intuitively the langauge selection boxes specify source and target languages. Available language pairs may vary according to the selected translation backend. Except for the default settings, translation backend, quality estimation backend, paraphraser backend and alignment backend can be further specified. It is however not required of the user to change the default backend settings. The settings burger menu is invoked by the menu symbol in the top left corner:
