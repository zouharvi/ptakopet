Just because a crosswalk looks like a hopscotch board doesn't mean it is one
Look both ways before you cross the street
Have you read the help file?
Odessa is a better game. Really.
Tourniquets are not recommended unless in the direst emergency
I could sure use a backrub right about now...
Monitors won't give you Vitamin D -- but sunlight will...
If you're ever lost and alone in the woods, hug a tree
Fishing wire makes bad dental floss
Consistency is key
When without a stapler, a staple and a ruler will work
Never blow in a dog's ear

You requested to remove a package which is an essential part of your system.
The connection to the daemon was lost. Most likely the background daemon crashed.
The installation or removal of a software package failed.
The requested feature is not supported.
There seems to be a programming error in aptdaemon, the software that allows you to install/remove software and to perform other package management related tasks.
This error could be caused by required additional software packages which are missing or not installable. Furthermore there could be a conflict between software packages which are not allowed to be installed at the same time.
This requires installing packages from unauthenticated sources.
The installation could have failed because of an error in the corresponding software package or it was cancelled in an unfriendly way. You have to repair this before you can install or remove any further software.
Please copy the file to your local computer and check the file permissions.
The installation of a package which violates the quality standards isn't allowed. This could cause serious problems on your computer. Please contact the person or organisation who provided this package file and include the details beneath.

Display some available commands at the top of the screen
If this option is enabled, a brief summary of some of the most important aptitude commands will appear beneath the menu bar.
Hide the menu bar when it is not being used
If this option is enabled, the menu bar will only appear when it has been activated by pressing the menu key.
Use a minibuffer-style prompt when possible
If this option is enabled, prompts will be displayed in a single line at the bottom of the screen. If not, prompts will be displayed as pop-up dialog boxes.
Show partial search results (incremental search)
If this option is enabled, aptitude will perform searches within the package list as you type them. This is convenient, but may slow the program down, particularly on older computers.
Closing the last view exits the program
If this option is enabled, aptitude will stop running when all views (package lists, package details, etc) have been closed. Otherwise, aptitude will continue running until you select 'Quit' from the Actions menu.
Prompt for confirmation at exit
If this option is enabled, aptitude will not terminate until you confirm that you really want to quit.
Pause after downloading files
This option controls whether aptitude will wait for confirmation after a download before it goes ahead and installs packages.
Never
Never wait for the user after downloading packages: always begin the installation immediately.
When an error occurs
Wait for confirmation if an error occurred during the download. If there were no errors, begin installing packages immediately.
Always
Always wait for the user to confirm the download before proceeding with the installation.
Use a 'status-line' download indicator for all downloads
If this option is enabled, aptitude will display the status of ongoing downloads at the bottom of the screen, rather than opening a new view.
Display the information area by default
If this option is enabled, the information area (the pane at the bottom of the screen) in the package list will be visible when the program starts; otherwise, it will be initially hidden.
Display tabs for the available views
If this option is enabled, tabs will appear at the top of the screen listing the currently opened views.
Display tabs for the information area
If this option is enabled, tabs will appear at the top of the information area (the pane at the bottom of the screen) listing the different displays of information that can be viewed there.
Advance to the next item after changing the state of a package
If this option is enabled, then performing an action on a package (for instance, installing or removing it) will move the selection to the next package in the list.
Automatically show why packages are broken
If this option is enabled, then highlighting a package that has broken dependencies will automatically display the dependencies that are unfulfilled in the lower pane of the display.
Display flat view instead of default view on startup
If this option is enabled, then the first view displayed on startup will be a flat view instead of the default view.
The default grouping method for package views
This option controls how aptitude organizes the package list. See the aptitude user's manual for information on how to specify a grouping method.
The default display-limit for package views
By default, the limit of each package view will be set to the value specified by this option. See the aptitude user's manual for detailed information about searches.
The display format for package views
This option controls how aptitude formats lines of the package list. See the aptitude user's manual for information on how to specify a display format.
The display format for the status line
This option controls how aptitude formats the status line (the line between the package list and the lower pane). See the aptitude user's manual for information on how to specify a display format.
The display format for the header line
This option controls how aptitude formats the header line (the line above the package list). See the aptitude user's manual for information on how to specify a display format.
Automatically upgrade installed packages
If this option is enabled, then on startup, aptitude will select all upgradable packages for upgrade.
Remove obsolete package files after downloading new package lists
If this option is enabled, then after every install run, aptitude will delete from the package cache any package files that can no longer be downloaded from any archive in sources.list.
URL to use to download changelogs
This option controls the server used to download changelogs. You should only need to change this if the changelogs move to a different URL.
Display a preview of what will be done before doing it
If this option is enabled, then when you ask aptitude to perform an install run, it will first display a summary of the actions it is going to perform.
Forget which packages are "new" whenever the package lists are updated
If this option is enabled, then aptitude will clear the list of new packages after you update the package lists (e.g., by pressing 'u').
Forget which packages are "new" whenever packages are installed or removed
If this option is enabled, then aptitude will clear the list of new packages after you perform an install run or install or remove packages from the command-line.
Do not display a warning when the first change is made in read-only mode
If this option is %Bnot%b enabled, aptitude will display a warning when you modify the state of a package if you do not have permissions to apply the change to the system.
Warn when attempting to perform a privileged action as a non-root user
If this option is enabled, aptitude will warn you when you attempt to perform an action which you do not have permission to do: for instance, installing packages as a non-root user. You will be given the option to log in as root and perform the action with root privileges.
File to log actions into
When you install or remove packages, a summary of what aptitude does will be written to this file. If the first character of the file name is a pipe character ('%B_BAR_%b'), the remainder of the name will be interpreted as a shell command that is to receive the log on standard input.
Automatically resolve dependencies of a package when it is selected
If this option is enabled, aptitude will use a simple heuristic to immediately resolve the dependencies of each package you flag for installation. This is much faster than the built-in dependency resolver, but may produce suboptimal results or fail entirely in some scenarios.
Automatically fix broken packages before installing or removing
If this option is enabled, and you perform an install run while some packages are broken, aptitude will automatically apply the current suggestion of the problem resolver. Otherwise, aptitude will prompt you for a solution to the broken dependencies.
Install recommended packages automatically
If this option is enabled and "automatically resolve dependencies" is also enabled, aptitude will attempt to install the recommendations of newly installed packages in addition to their outright dependencies. Suggestions will not be automatically installed. If this option is enabled and "Remove unused packages automatically" is enabled, packages that are recommended by an installed package will not be automatically removed.
Remove unused packages automatically
If this option is enabled, packages that are automatically installed and that no manually installed package depends on will be removed from the system. Cancelling the removal will flag the package as manually installed. If this option is enabled and "Install recommended packages automatically" is enabled, automatically installed packages will not be removed if any installed package recommends them.
Packages that should never be automatically removed
Packages matching this search pattern will always be treated as if an installed package depends on them: they will never be targeted for removal as unused packages.
Allow dependency resolutions that break holds or forbids
If this option is enabled, then whenever aptitude solves a dependency problem, it will consider modifying held packages, or installing forbidden package versions. With this option disabled, these solutions will be rejected by default. NOTE: At present, this restriction only applies to situations in which aptitude's dependency resolver (the red bar at the bottom of the screen) is activated. aptitude will still break holds when automatically installing the dependencies of a package that has just been selected for installation or upgrade, due to apt bug #470035.

Packages with unsatisfied dependencies The dependency requirements of these packages will be unmet after the install is complete. . The presence of this tree probably indicates that something is broken, either on your system or in the Debian archive.
Packages being removed because they are no longer used These packages are being deleted because they were automatically installed to fulfill dependencies, and the planned action will result in no installed package declaring an 'important' dependency on them.
Packages being automatically held in their current state These packages could be upgraded, but they have been kept in their current state to avoid breaking dependencies.
Packages being automatically installed to satisfy dependencies These packages are being installed because they are required by another package you have chosen for installation.
Packages being deleted due to unsatisfied dependencies These packages are being deleted because one or more of their dependencies is no longer available, or because another package conflicts with them.
Packages to be downgraded An older version of these packages than is currently installed will be installed.
Packages being held back These packages could be upgraded, but you have asked for them to be held at their current version.
Packages to be reinstalled These packages will be reinstalled.
Packages to be installed These packages have been manually selected for installation on your computer.
Packages to be removed These packages have been manually selected for removal.
Packages to be upgraded These packages will be upgraded to a newer version.
Packages that are partially installed These packages are not fully installed and configured; an attempt will be made to complete their installation.
